    "GOOGLE_MAPS_LINK": "google_maps_link",
    "RADIUS": "search_radius_in_meters",
    "MESSAGE_LIMIT": "max_messages_to_send",
    "search_phrase": "business_type_to_search",
    "country_code_file": "path_to_country_codes.csv",

## Usage

1. Ensure all configuration files are properly set up
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

The script will:
1. Load all necessary configuration
2. Search for businesses based on your criteria
3. Create a folder structure for the search results
4. Send WhatsApp messages to found businesses
5. Track successful messages
6. Generate detailed logs

## Folder Structure

For each search, the script creates:
```
search_phrase/
├── requests_search_phrase.csv  # All found businesses
└── form_search_phrase.csv      # Successfully contacted businesses
```

## Logging

The script creates a detailed log file: `log_script_initial_contact.log`
- Tracks all operations
- Records errors and successes
- Helps in troubleshooting

## Safety Features
